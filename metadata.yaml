description: "A Tale of a Tub was the first major work written by Jonathan Swift,\
  \ arguably his most difficult satire and perhaps his most masterly. The Tale is\
  \ a prose parody divided into sections of \"digression\" and a \"tale\" of three\
  \ brothers, each representing one of the main branches of western Christianity.\
  \ Composed between 1694 and 1697, it was eventually published in 1704. It was long\
  \ regarded as a satire on religion, and has famously been attacked for that, starting\
  \ with William Wotton.\nThe \"tale\" presents a consistent satire of religious excess,\
  \ while the digressions are a series of parodies of contemporary writing in literature,\
  \ politics, theology, Biblical exegesis, and medicine. The overarching parody is\
  \ of enthusiasm, pride, and credulity. At the time it was written, politics and\
  \ religion were still closely linked in England, and the religious and political\
  \ aspects of the satire can often hardly be separated. \"The work made Swift notorious,\
  \ and was widely misunderstood, especially by Queen Anne herself who mistook its\
  \ purpose for profanity.\" \"It effectively disbarred its author from proper preferment\
  \ within the church,\" but is considered one of Swift's best allegories, even by\
  \ himself. It was enormously popular, but Swift believed it damaged his prospect\
  \ of advancement in the Church of England.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
